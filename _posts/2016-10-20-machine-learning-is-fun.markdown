[Machine Learning is Fun!](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471#.mvx3h7e3z)

> This guide is for anyone who is curious about machine learning but has no idea where to start. I imagine there are a lot of people who tried reading the wikipedia article, got frustrated and gave up wishing someone would just give them a high-level explanation. That’s what this is.

This is a great five-part introduction to machine learing.
