[uWebSockets/uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)

> ÂµWS is one of the most lightweight, efficient & scalable WebSocket server implementations available. It features an easy-to-use, fully async object-oriented interface and scales to millions of connections using only a fraction of memory compared to the competition.

Can be dropped into Socket.io as the websocket implementation so you can still get all of socket.io's fallback goodness.
