## Me

I'm a full-stack developer currently working with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), most recently at [Zipwhip](http://www.zipwhip.com) where I was building the next generation of Zipwhip's applications in Node and React.

[Here's a summary](/resume/) of what I have done.


## This Site

Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) and hosted via [Surge](https://surge.sh). Significant inspiration from [Darning Fireball](http://daringfireball.net) use of link posts. I don't write often, but I always have links to share or to go back to for reference, so many posts link out to interesting articles or projects on the web.
