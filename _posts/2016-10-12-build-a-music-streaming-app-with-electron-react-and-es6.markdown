[Build a Music Streaming App With Electron, React & ES6](https://www.sitepoint.com/music-streaming-app-electron-react-es6/)


Electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies â€“ javascript, HTML, CSS, Angular, React or whatever. Created by Github, it powers the [Atom editor](https://atom.io) (also by Github), as well as other apps such as Slack, Hyper, and Visual Studio Code. Its a really cool piece of technology that puts a lot of power to develop desktop apps in the hands of developers who don't have (or don't want to) get into platform-specific desktop technologies.
