[{{ page.title }}]({{ page.linkhref }})

> With the recent advancements in transportation and smart vehicles, I was surprised to find that electronic vehicles and smart cars still lack the ability to measure and analyze real-time motion data given the significance of insights possible. Realizing the value of the kinetic data and the diversity of insights, I decided to create a fully connected IoT device that can quantify 3D acceleration data and enable real-time analyses and visualization of that 3D motion data. Furthermore, I coupled this data with noise and temperature information to create additional context and implement safety features.

Despite the obtuse title, looks liek a cool little project using the Onion Omega2 platform to build a vehicle telemetry app using AWS Iot and Kinesis.
