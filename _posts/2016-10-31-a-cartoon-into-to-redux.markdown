> One thing that causes even more confusion than Flux is the difference between Flux and Redux, a pattern that was inspired by Flux. In this article Iâ€™ll explain the differences between the two.

A super-accessable introduciton to Redux, with lots of pictures. This was published last year, but I still love how [Lin Clark](http://twitter.com/codecartoons) did this. (bonus four-part series on [Relay](https://code-cartoons.com/@linclark) too)
