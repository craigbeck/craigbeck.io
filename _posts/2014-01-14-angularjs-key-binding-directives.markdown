[mgo-mousetrap](https://github.com/mgonto/mgo-mousetrap) is a cool
looking AngularJS library for binding keyboard events in the
browser using directives.

I love when web apps provide nice keyboard shortcuts and it's something
I add where appropriate to improve the UX experience, so this will be
going in the toolbox for later.
