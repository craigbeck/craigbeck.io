[This
article](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html) by [Tero Parviainen](http://teropa.info) ([@teropa](https://twitter.com/teropa))
is one of the best full-stack Redux & React examples I've come across
lately, covering the server-side, thinking about application state,
socket.io, and testing react components. 

Well worth the read.
