> Throughout the last few years I’ve taught React in just about every popular medium. Throughout that time I’ve been taking notes on what triggers these “aha” moments, specifically for learning React. About two weeks ago I came across this Reddit thread which had the same idea. So what I want to do in this post is share my collection of these moments while also adding my thoughts on some of the moments shared in that Reddit thread. Hopefully it will help React “click” for you if it hasn’t yet.
