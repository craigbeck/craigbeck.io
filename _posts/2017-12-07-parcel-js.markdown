> Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler

I was just talking with some folks at a meetup last night about the pain of webpack configuration. In previous jobs, spinning up a new app was a regular thing so I got pretty adept at doing the webpack dance, but at the current gig, I'm working on a large React app that was setup before I got here so I havent had to dive into webpack for over a year! This is going on the short list of things to check out with my next pide project.
