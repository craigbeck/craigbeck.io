Status: Currently open to new opportunities in the Seattle area or remotely (no relocation). Most interested in front-end or full-stack position with Node, Elixir, and React.

<hr/>

The language I am currently most fluent in is **Javascript** for both client and server development, although I have done work with Java, C#, and Python, I am most passionate to work with **node.js**, or **Elixir** and **Erlang** to create [native web apps](https://blog.andyet.com/2015/01/22/native-web-apps) and supporting APIs.

I am most comfortable with agile development processes and enjoy pair-programming and practicing <abbr title="Test Diven Development">[TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)</abbr> and <abbr title="Behaviour Diven Development">[BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)</abbr>
