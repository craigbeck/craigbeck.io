> As seen on TV! What if you could increase the resolution of your photos using technology from CSI laboratories? Thanks to deep learning and #NeuralEnhance, it's now possible to train a neural network to zoom in to your images at 2x or even 4x. You'll get even better results by increasing the number of neurons or training with a dataset similar to your low resolution image.

I remember [the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHepKd38pr0) from Blade Runner with Deckard "enhancing" a low quality photo to reveal details not visible in the original, so literally, science-ficiton in 1984. Cue ahead a couple of decades and I would have been complaining about the bullshit they pull in shows like CSI (if you could have got me to watch it) when it comes to this stuff. Now it's real, and downloadable from Github, and available in a docker image...
