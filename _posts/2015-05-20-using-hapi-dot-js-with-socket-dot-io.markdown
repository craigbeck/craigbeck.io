[Using hapi.js with socket.io](http://matt-harrison.com/using-hapi-js-with-socket-io/)<br/>
Matt Harrison (author of the upcoming book "Hapi.js in Action") has a good post on using [hapi.js](http://hapijs.com) with [socket.io](http://socket.io). It's really simple to set up and he shows a couple of more interesting examples when using hapi when listening on multiple ports.

[SocketCluster](http://socketcluster.io)<br/>
SocketCluster is an open-source multi-process clustered framework built to scale across multiple cores and multiple instances. It looks very interesting for taking a lot of the concerns for scaling a socket service and providing a framework for plugging in your own code. I haven't used this yet but look forward using it.
