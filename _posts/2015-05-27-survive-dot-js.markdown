[Survive.js](http://survivejs.com) is a fantastic book on
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). It's an open source ebook and is
still under development but I've found quite a few things I didn't know
and could immediately apply to my current React+Webpack projects.
Webpack is an amazing tool but it has a steep learning curve (and the
documentation is lacking) so I wish I had this months ago!
