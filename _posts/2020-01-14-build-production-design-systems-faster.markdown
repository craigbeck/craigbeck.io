> Storybook began with a simple goal: help developers build UI components and their key states. This is the easiest, most efficient way to think through component hierarchies
>
> However, the bar on UI development has also been raised. In 2020, it’s not enough to provide great tooling for building and testing components. Today’s modern frontend teams also need to document and package their components into reusable design systems.

Storybook is one of my favorite tools for UI-first development, and I'm looking forward to checking out their latest 5.3 release with [MDX doc capabilities](https://medium.com/storybookjs/rich-docs-with-storybook-mdx-61bc145ae7bc)
