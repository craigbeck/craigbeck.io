> With Redux, you can use combineReducers to create nested reducers that only operate on a slice of state, but all reducers still respond to all actions. Often this is the pointâ€”a component can affect another component just by dispatching an action. But when we started creating multiple instances of the same component, we created a system where every instance responded to action meant for just one.
