[A "Mostly Adequate" guide to funcitonal programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/). Going onto the reading list. 

Written using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) which is a really cool tool
for writing online books. _I wish they had a way to star or add books to
a library_ as it is... I'll just have to drop this link here.
