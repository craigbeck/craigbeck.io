[React Route v6 overview]({{ page.linkhref }})

This is big news! I've been waiting for v6 for forever and a day (at least). One legacy app with react-router v4, and another app using v5, and this version looks to have everythign I've wanted. I have to say the road ahs been a bit rocky with react-router over the years-- breaking API changes between v3 and v4 for example, as well as losing features, or steps backwards at times -- but this release looks solid, checking off all the boxes for what I'd hope it would be. 

Nice work
