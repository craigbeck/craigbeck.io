> When you’re first starting out, your project probably doesn’t need to be isomorphic. You don’t need bundle splitting, you don’t need internationalization support or offline-first, and you don’t need advanced routing. In fact, you probably don’t need Redux at all!

Excellent advice -- start simple and then add the things you need. Not every app needs every go-to library.
