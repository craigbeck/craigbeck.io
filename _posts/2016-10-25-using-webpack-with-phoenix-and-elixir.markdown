[Using Webpack with Phoenix and Elixir](http://matthewlehner.net/using-webpack-with-phoenix-and-elixir/)

> Phoenix, by default, uses Brunch for a build tool – and for most folks, it’ll work, but I’ve grown fond of webpack because of features like hot module replacement and the ease of configuring loaders/processors in the build process. In my opinion, Elixir and Phoenix is the best for choice for server side architecture currently, so, naturally these should be paired with the best client side tools.
