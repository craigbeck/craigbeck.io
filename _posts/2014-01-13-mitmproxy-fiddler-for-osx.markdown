One of the tools I miss from developing on Windows is [Fiddler](http://fiddler2.com). It is the best tool I've used for inspecting and debugging HTTP traffic and something I turned to frequently when developing service and client-side code. They do have an "alpha" build for Linux and OSX on the Mono framework, but last I checked it was so buggy as to be unusable. Recently I discovered the python project [MITMProxy](http://mitmproxy.org/doc/mitmproxy.html) which is a commandline tool that has a lot of the same features as Fiddler. Its a UI in the terminal, which I don't mind at all as long as its usable and the features are there.
