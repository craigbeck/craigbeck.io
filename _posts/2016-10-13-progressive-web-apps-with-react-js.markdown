[Addy Oasami](https://addyosmani.com) has written an excellent new series on creating progressive web apps with React. Theres a *lot* to digest here...

> There’s much new in the world of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and you might be wondering how compatible they are with existing architectures using libraries like React and JS module bundlers like Webpack. Does a PWA require a wholesale rewrite? What web performance metrics do you need to keep an eye on? In this series of posts I’ll share my experience turning React-based web apps into PWAs. We’ll also cover why shipping just what users need for a route & throwing out all other scripts are good ideas for fast perf.
