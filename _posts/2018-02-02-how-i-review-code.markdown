> Reviewing code is one of the most important parts of an engineer’s job at Tumblr, even more so than writing code. Our codebases are shared by hundreds of engineers, so it’s critical to make sure we’re not just writing the best code we can, but that the code being written can be understood by others. Taking the time to review someone else’s code is the most critical opportunity to ensure all of that is happening.
