[The State of Javascript 2016](http://stateofjs.com)

> Depending on who you ask, right now JavaScript is either turning into a modern, reliable language, or a bloated, overly complex dependency hell. Or maybe both?

Overall, ES6 is king, Coffeescript is done, and people are still creating new syntax/languages that will compile to javascript.

As to frameworks, I was surprised (or... maybe not?) that more people would *not* use Angular again (34%) than would (30%). Not surprising... (uh confimation bias?) React is hot, *and* developers are satisfied with it (54% would use again vs 5% would not). Also... Redux is king for state management (which looks like a React-only question. I'm not sure if other frameworks use these)
