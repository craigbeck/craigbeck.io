[RethinkDB is shutting down](https://rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-shutdown/)

> Today I have sad news to share. After more than seven years of development, the company behind RethinkDB is shutting down. We worked very hard to make RethinkDB successful, but in spite of all our efforts we were ultimately unable to build a sustainable business. There is a lot of information to unpack – over the next few months, I’ll write about lessons learned so the startup community can benefit from our mistakes.

This is a bummer. I really liked RethinkDB a lot.
