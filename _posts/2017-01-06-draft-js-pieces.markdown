> [Draft-js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/) is a highly programmatic rich text editor created by facebook.  But it’s not what you might expect.  Draft-js is just the underpinnings, leaving everything, and I mean everything, else up to you.  When you render an Editor you get a textbox.  This is because facebook wanted rich text in a number of different contexts, like all that commenting crap they do.  I don’t know.

A useful seven-part series introducing the essential components of Facebook's Draft.js text editor.
