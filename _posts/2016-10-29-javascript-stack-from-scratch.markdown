[JavaScript Stack From Scratch](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/blob/master/README.md)

> This is a minimalistic and straight to the point guide to assembling a JavaScript stack. It teaches you how to set up ES6, Babel, Gulp, ESLint, React, Redux, Webpack, Immutable, Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and Flow. It requires some general programming knowledge, and JavaScript basics. It focuses on wiring all these tools together and giving you the simplest possible example for each tool. You can see this tutorial as a way to write your own boilerplate from scratch.

This is a super useful guide to all the steps _before_ you you even start to dive into the first feature of your next killer app. I've done all these things many times over, and with the rate of change in javascript font-end tooling (google "javascript fatigue") there's been many variations to this, although they all are wiring up the basics of libraries, build, test etc.
