> I’ve wanted to build something using Flow since José Valim introduced the concepts behind it in his Elixir Conf 2016 keynote. I initially thought of building a product recommendation tool using crowdsourced reviews. As it would include both IO intensive stages, such as HTTP requests, and CPU intensive stages, like sentiment analysis. A good candidate for parallel processing and suitable for using Flow.

I'm still pretty new to Elixir but can see there's a lot of great stuff in this project to learn from.
